# Tarzan the Wonder Car: Street Segmentation for Lane and Traffic Sign Detection

Tarzan the Wonder Car is an innovative project aimed at enhancing road safety through advanced computer vision techniques. We have developed a YOLO (You Only Look Once) model for street segmentation to detect lanes and traffic signs in real-time scenarios. This repository contains the source code and resources necessary to train and deploy the model for effective lane detection and traffic sign recognition.

## Overview

Our project leverages the power of deep learning and computer vision to detect lanes and traffic signs on roads. By employing the YOLO model, we achieve real-time street segmentation, allowing for quick and accurate detection of lane markings and traffic signs, thereby aiding in navigation and ensuring safer driving experiences.

## Key Features

- **YOLO Model**: We have trained a YOLO model capable of detecting lanes and traffic signs simultaneously, providing comprehensive street segmentation.
- **Lane Detection**: The model identifies lane markings on roads, enabling vehicles to stay within lanes and navigate safely.
- **Traffic Sign Detection**: Our model detects various traffic signs, including stop signs, yield signs, speed limit signs, etc., contributing to better traffic management and adherence to road regulations.
- **Real-time Processing**: The system operates in real-time, providing instantaneous feedback to drivers, enhancing situational awareness, and facilitating timely decision-making.
